# Gameplay

## Overview of Gameplay
The player enters a room, and is presented with enemies in their path. They shoot their bow, swing their sword, and block attacks while dealing knockback with their shield. The player loots the dead bodies for arrows refills, bread to restore health, potions to increase their maximum health, and whetstones to increase their damage output. After defeating all the enemies, the player goes to the next room.

## Player Experience
When you start a run of King Slayer, you spawn in the overworld overlooking the castle. Here you can explore the village, fight weak versions of enemies, and find some hidden items before entering the castle. Once you are ready, you enter the castle to begin your conquest. You traverse a random assortment of rooms, each with unique layouts, enemy placement, and item spawns. In a room, you will defeat all the enemies in your path before the door to the next room opens. Use your sword, shield, and bow to defeat the enemies in your way! After traveling through 14 floors, you reach the 15th floor and are confronted by the king himself. Defeat him in a final decisive battle to claim the kingdom as your own!

## Gameplay Guidelines
King Slayer is a game targeted to teens, so there will be mild violence and/or gore. This will not be excessive, but it will be present. Furthermore, King Slayer is to stick to a medieval theme. There will be no futuristic elements, and anything included that is not accurate to historical medieval settings will be magical in nature. There are fantasy-esque characters and attacks, but nothing based in futuristic technology.

## Game Objectives & Rewards
Rewards of killing enemies/beating levels/rooms are arrows, bread, healing potions, and whetstones. Enemies will pose a challenge to the player, forcing them to engage in combat. The difficulty will increase as the player goes deeper into the castle, eventually resulting in a boss battle with the King. Some examples of difficulty increases are enemies getting more health or more damage as the player progresses through the castle.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The player will have WASD movement, Jumping, Attacking by swinging a sword, Attacking by shooting a bow, Blocking with a shield, and Knockback with a Shield Bash. They will be able to pick up bread (which heal them), Whetstones (which increase damage), Healing Potions (which increase their max health), and Arrows (which allow them to use their bow more).

## Level Design
The game will include three categories of levels: outdoor overworld, castle interior, and throne room.

The overworld will consist of an outdoor terrain with the castle in the center. It will have slight hills, trees, grass, and rocks in the terrain. There will be a small marketplace filled with NPCs in front of the castle, and there will be various enemies in the terrain outside of the marketplace. The player can find items hidden around the overworld before entering the castle.

The castle interior will consist of 14 (change?) rooms built from 7 (change?) layout templates. The templates will each have 5 (change?) variants with different enemy/item placements. These rooms will be largely grid placed and will contain obstacles/elevated terrain that the player can use to their advantage in combat. There is one entrance and one exit to these rooms, with the exit only opening after all the enemies have been defeated. As the player progresses through each room, the enemies will get stronger, gaining more health and dealing more damage to the player.

The throne room is the final area in the castle. It is a large, open space with a throne in the back. It will feel regal and important - the culmination of the journey before. Here, the player will fight and defeat the king, allowing them to take over the kingdom.

## Control Scheme
This game will use a standard keyboard for the controls.

## Button/ Touch Input	Action it Performs
W/A/S/D - Movement keys
SPACE - Jump
1 - Equip Sword
2 - Equip Shield
3 - Equip Bow

## Game Aesthetics & User Interface
This game will have a medieval setting and a realistic art style. The characters, items, and environments will look like they could reasonably belong in the real world, but may have some fantastical elements to them. The players will move in a realistic way, with no absurdly exaggerated movement.

This game aims to make the player feel questionable about their actions. As they progress, they will realize they may be conquering the kingdom for malicious reasons, and that their character may not be the beacon of hope they initially thought they were.

Concerning the UI, we will aim to create a design that does not take up too much of the screen. On the title screen, buttons will be centered and include options to start the game, change settings, or quit the game. The title screen will include a slight camera animation and the game's title above the buttons. As for the pause screen, this will appear on the side of the screen, allowing the player to still see their environment while paused. It will include buttons to resume the game, change the settings, or return to the title screen.
