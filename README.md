# High Concept Statement
In 1-2 sentences, explain the game as if you were pitching it to potential players, publishers, funders and developers. This should be very intriguing. It typically includes the title, genre, platform, and brief idea of what the player does or has to overcome. Seriously, two sentences max.

# Genre
In games, the genre is what the player does most. Examples of game genres are, shooter, platformer, action/adventure, survival/horror, rhythm, casual, puzzle, god, battle royale. Please use a game genre and not a setting. If you don’t know the difference, please ask.

# Platforms
List or describe the platforms the game will be made for such as PC, mobile, console, handheld. Basically, just put Mac or PC because that is what this class is about.

# Target Audience
Provide information on the audience the game is targeted to. Add details and information on the intended audience such as their habits, behaviors, likes, and dislikes. Are you targeting your game to a specific age group or perhaps people that enjoy certain genres? Is your intended audience from specific communities? Also, don’t say the class or professor, think about your audience. Example: A game for 8–12-year-old girls who are ballet or modern dancers. The likely have limited exposure to PC games. This game speaks to them as sophisticated members of the dance community while taking an informative perspective on dance in a game.

# Gameplay

## Overview of Gameplay
Discuss the actions the player will perform as they make their way through the game. Core mechanic and a core loop are part of gameplay, lets examine all three. A core mechanic could be: pressing a button to animate your gun to a shooting position, pressing another button to shoot then pressing first button to holster the gun. A core loop is: player shoots an enemy, takes cover, throws a grenade, waits and shoots again forming the loop. Gameplay over all is the player shoots, takes cover, loots dead bodies, finds ammo, finds audio tapes, plays audio tapes to understand to complete the next part of their quest.

## Player Experience
Provide a general overview of how the player experiences the game. Walk them through the screens they will see, what the level looks like and what their character can do. Give them a brief idea of objectives & hazards they will face.  This should be in a second-person point of view using the word “you” to tell a story to the audience (players). Example: West of House. You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.

## Gameplay Guidelines
This is a set of guidelines that the game must adhere to throughout the development process. These include rules for what is allowed and not allowed in the game.
